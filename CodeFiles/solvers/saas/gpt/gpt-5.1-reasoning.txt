I’m grappling with the fact that gcd(a-b, n) requires knowledge of n, which I don't have. I think about computing gcd using the difference in sums of square roots: gcd(r1^2 - r2^2) relates to (r1-r2)(r1+r2), but again, we lack n. I can only work with integers I know, like r1-r2 and r1+r2, but that's not helpful. I wonder if there's a way to derive n from interactions or if there's some bug affecting my results.
