The key vulnerability here is that the square root oracle allows us to get information about the private key structure. In many cryptosystems, having access to a decryption oracle (like a square root oracle) can lead to complete breaks of the system. The most direct attack is to see if the square root itself can serve as a valid signature, which exploits the mathematical relationship between square roots and the signature verification.
