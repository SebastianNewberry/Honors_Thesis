# No Solution Provided
# Reasoning: 
# Thus the oracle f returns a random square root of one of those four quadratic residues (the residues being the four numbers that are squares of the roots). 
# Actually, f(x) is a number such that f(x)^2 is congruent to something that is either x or -x mod p and mod q in some combination.
