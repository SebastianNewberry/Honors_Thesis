\begin{abstract}
  Open-source large language models (LLMs) have closed much, but not all, of the gap with frontier proprietary systems, and their relative standing varies sharply by benchmark family. On knowledge-heavy and long-horizon reasoning tasks (e.g., Humanity’s Last Exam, GPQA-Diamond, MMLU-Pro), top closed models such as GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Grok 4 generally have the edge over open source LLMs. By contrast, recent open models (DeepSeek, GLM-4.6, Kimi K2) can often match peers in coding and web-agent tasks, especially when tool use is allowed. Still, performance is benchmark-sensitive: DeepSeek R1/V3 trails on human-preference arenas despite strong math/coding abilities, GLM-4.6 excels at coding but not always at long-form reasoning, and Kimi K2 leads in some agentic evaluations yet lags behind top proprietary models on others. In this report, both closed and open source LLMs will be tested to determine their ability to apply knowledge to complex cybersecurity problems. To accomplish this, capture the flag (CTF) challenges will be used in an attempt to emulate a real-world cyber environment where a company could decide to use an LLM. In a CTF challenge, users are tasked with challenges to exploit vulnerabilities in a simulated environment. Once the user is successful in exploiting the controlled environment, they receive a string of text which is the flag. The challenges vary in complexity and often have multiple solutions, but they almost all require complex thinking and problem-solving abilities to work through them. The CTF challenge in this report is a multi-step problem that requires lots of thinking and effort to solve correctly. By measuring the ability for LLMs to solve cybersecurity challenges, we can determine if they are suitable for solving real-world cybersecurity problems.

\section{Introduction}
Companies today are turning to automated solutions like large language models to penetration test their infrastructure. Proprietary models like OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, and xAI's Grok offer strong performance, but also have drawbacks in terms of different aspects of the CIA triad that are vital to cybersecurity. The CIA triad stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each aspect of this triad is challenged in some way when a company decides to rely on a proprietary LLM over an open-source LLM that is hosted on local infrastructure.

\subsection{CIA Triad}

\subsubsection{What is the CIA Triad}

The CIA triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. According to Geeks4Geeks, the CIA Triad is a foundational model in information security \parencite{geeksforgeeks_cia_triad}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Confidentiality}: Ensures that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized users and protected from unauthorized disclosure or access.
  \item \textbf{Integrity}: Maintains the accuracy and reliability of data, ensuring it has not been altered or tampered with by unauthorized individuals.
  \item \textbf{Availability}: Guarantees that data, systems, and resources remain accessible to authorized users when needed, minimizing downtime and disruptions.
\end{itemize}

Overall, this serves as a guide for companies on to how to properly protect, maintain, and protect internal systems, networks, and customer data policies. 

\subsubsection{Confidentiality}  
When a provider fine-tunes or prompts a model on customer data, that content may be stored or reused for future training. Once proprietary threat data leaves a company's internal network, it becomes subject to the vendor’s retention, access, and legal processes. This poses unique risks for both blue and red teams. Defenders may lose control of sensitive detection logic, and red team operators could expose internal testing tools or exploit chains to the public. Running models locally removes this risk because prompts stay within the company, and all data remains under the company's control. This supports the confidentiality principle of cybersecurity because confidentiality involves protecting both business practices and customer data. When a company uses a proprietary model like Claude's Anthropic, they are giving the LLM provider full permission to do what they want with that company's provided input.

According to the \textit{Anthropic terms of service}, \begin{quote}We may use Materials to provide, maintain, and improve the Services and to develop other products and services, including training our models, unless you opt out of training through your account settings. Even if you opt out, we will use Materials for model training when: (1) you provide Feedback to us regarding any Materials, or (2) your Materials are flagged for safety review to improve our ability to detect harmful content, enforce our policies, or advance our safety research.\end{quote} \parencite{anthropic_consumer_terms}

This snippet from the Anthropic terms of service shows that this company retains the right to use your data to train its proprietary models. Other proprietary providers like OpenAI and xAI have similar policies. They phrase their terms of service to make it appear like clients can easily opt out of any sort of data training, but these conditions offer no reliable way to ensure data protection. Using an open source LLM prevents this risk.

\subsubsection{Integrity}

Large language model providers face intense pressure to moderate and censor model outputs when user interactions trigger sensitive issues. For instance, in November 2025, a lawsuit alleged that ChatGPT encouraged a user to commit suicide rather than redirect him to proper care, spurring public backlash and regulatory scrutiny \parencite{chatgpt_suicide_lawsuit}.

Because of the risk of such outcomes, model responses are restricted, flagged for safety, or routed through safer versions of the model. These measures are intended to protect users, but they are simultaneously reducing the model’s openness and spontaneity, limiting how far users can customize prompts or explore unusual content. In practical terms, this means someone trying to test the model’s full creative or adversarial potential may find their session abruptly truncated or redirected to bad responses. In the context of red-teaming, what begins as free exploration can quickly convert into “safe mode” or refusal behavior. Often times when end users ask these AI models things like, \enquote{Can you help me hack into this system?} The AI will refuse because the request is unethical. For blue teams responsible for defensive cybersecurity operations, this means that model access may be constrained when they ask the model to simulate threat actor behaviour or generate exploit chains. The system may refuse or degrade answers, citing policy violation. The red team that is trying to push the model to its limits when it comes to hacking test environments will also encounter this same limitation. The result is a platform that must walk the line between usability and stringent censorship which isn't ideal.

This censorship concern has been shown in the past with DeepSeek censoring political content critical of the Chinese government or CCP. However, because DeepSeek is open-source, hobbyists and organizations can fine-tune and adjust the model to remove or reduce bias and censorship.

According to Wired, \enquote{Hugging Face is also working on a project called Open R1 based on DeepSeek’s model. This project aims to \enquote{deliver a fully open-source framework,} Yakefu says. The fact that R1 has been released as an open-source model \enquote{enables it to transcend its origins and be customized to meet diverse needs and values.}} \parencite{wired_deepseek_censorship}

In this conference paper by Noels, the authors thoroughly studied the censorship of AI by classifying it into soft and hard censorship \parencite{noels_llm_censorship}. The authors of this conference paper conducted an experiment in order to determine how prominent censorship is in LLMs. The experiment evaluated a dataset of 300,000 descriptions of political figures by LLMs filtered to 2,371 persons with occupations of social activists, political scientists, diplomats, politicians, and military personnel. The authors reviewed how the LLMs answered questions about these figures, comparing instances of hard and soft censorship across countries of origin and different models. They also also measured censorship results for different large language models based on the phrasing that was used to prompt the model.

According to the conference paper:

\begin{quote}
  The prompting strategy is simple: each LLM in each language is asked about each political figure \enquote{Tell me about [Person X].} Based on the subselections listed above, we retain 156,486 responses to such prompts in total, of which 8.8\% are marked as hallucinations (see Appendix A) and 3.3\% as refusals. Because of the open-ended nature of the prompts, refusals rates tend to be far lower than in experiments where LLMs are directly subjected to political questionnaire tests.
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{hard_vs_soft_censorship.png}
  \caption{Different types of hard and soft censorship}
  \label{fig:types-of-censorship}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:types-of-censorship} categorizes soft censorship into two types: \enquote{omission of praise} which refers to censorship that withholds credit for a positive contribution to accepted standards, and \enquote{omission of allegation} which refers to refusing to acknowledge a negative action or standard violation. It defines hard censorship as refusing to answer prompts by either giving another internet source to refer to (canned refusal), generating a response telling the user that it can't respond (generated refusal), or explicitly refusing to respond generating an API error or returning no text (error refusal).

    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{Censorship and political leaders in LLMs based on prompting language and person's country of birth}
    \label{fig:hard-and-soft-censorship}
\end{figure}

\cref{fig:hard-and-soft-censorship} (a) and (b) demonstrate the results of the experiment that these authors conducted. These results demonstrate that LLMs don't often exhibit hard censorship on political leaders besides the GigaChat model for the Russian language. This model shows hard censorship in \cref{fig:hard-and-soft-censorship} (a). This is most likely due to Russian authorities restricting the model from returning negative content about political leaders. \cref{fig:hard-and-soft-censorship} (b) shows that Wenxiaoyan and YandexGPT have high rates of both praise and accusation omission. The study also shows that soft censorship occurs more often than hard censorship. This poses a problem for users because soft censorship involves the AI censoring by excluding relevant information instead of refusing to answer. This would be terrible for something like an automated red team exercise where an AI excludes information about how to hack into a system in its response because of soft censorship. Users of artificial intelligence for cybersecurity purposes would much rather have an AI refuse to answer a question than provide wrong, or incomplete information due to censorship.

\subsubsection{Availability}

Penetration tests are often run during maintenance windows or incident-response escalations that tolerate zero external dependencies.  Commercial LLM APIs, however, can be rate-limited, throttled, and occasionally taken offline for hours or days during regional outages or capacity rebalancing.  A red-team exercise that stalls because of an availability failure can have negative effects on a company's bottom line.  Hosting open source models on internal GPU clusters can ensure that spontaneous third-party outages don't impact or negatively affect a company's infrastructure.

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{General Benchmarks}

To determine whether a new model represents an improvement over an old model, AI researchers rely on benchmarks. Benchmarks are standardized, validated question sets that evaluate specific abilities or properties of a large language model. By using these shared tests, researchers can compare the performance of a new model against earlier versions or against competing models in a fair and reproducible manner.

\subsubsection{MMLU, GPQA, HLE, and SWE Bench-Verified}

\textbf{Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU)} is a benchmark focused on measuring the ability for language models to complete multi-task problems in a variety of domains. MMLU-PRO was designed to improve on this benchmark. The questions in the original MMLU benchmark consist of multiple choice questions that primarily only required knowledge to solve and not reasoning. Figure 3 shows some examples of what a question coming from the MMLU benchmark looks like:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{MMLU_Sample_Questions.png}
    \caption{Examples from the conceptual physics and college mathematics STEM tasks. \parencite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}}
    \label{fig:MMLU-Sample-Questions}
\end{figure}

According to the MMLU-PRO paper, \enquote{The questions in MMLU are mostly knowledge-driven without requiring too much reasoning, especially in the STEM subjects, which reduces its difficulty. In fact, most models achieve better performance with \enquote{direct} answer prediction without chain-of-thought} \parencite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}.

The following benchmarks are provided by the MMLU-PRO paper:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{MMLU_PRO.png}
    \caption{MMLU-PRO benchmark results for open-source and proprietary models \parencite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}}
    \label{fig:MMLU-PRO}
\end{figure}

In these benchmarks, it is obvious that the top 7 proprietary models were measured to be more perfomant than the top 7 open source models based on overall percentage scores for number of questions answered correctly from the MMLU-PRO question bank. This is a significant finding, but I believe that it isn't as applicable to the competition between open-source and proprietary models today. This paper was made on November 6th, 2024. Since then a multitude of newer models have come out.

\textbf{GPQA \texorpdfstring{(Google-Proof Q\&A Benchmark)}} is a benchmark focused on making multiple choice problems that are difficult to answer even by PHD researchers. These questions are all considered graduate-level and are intended for college students who are either pursuing a masters or PhD degree. Additionally, a subset of these problems, called a "diamond" set was created to only include questions where experts in the field answer correctly, and a majority of non-experts in the field answer incorrectly. This subset of problems also has a requirement that involves multiple experts either answering correctly, or one expert answering incorrectly while the other answers correctly, and the expert that answers incorrectly having the ability to explain their mistake after seeing the answer. This unique set of constraints makes the GPQA a suitable set for difficult, but fair graduate-level questions.

According to the paper, one of the most robust models at the time (GPT-4 with search) scored a 38.8\% on the diamond set \parencite{rein2023gpqagraduatelevelgoogleproofqa}. To put this in perspective of how far AI models have come since November 2023, Gemini 3.0 Pro scored 91.8\% on the same set of questions (shown in \cref{fig:gemini-benchmarks}).

\textbf{Humanity's Last Exam (HLE)} is a multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate AI models at the frontier of human knowledge across diverse academic disciplines. Developed collaboratively by subject-matter experts worldwide, HLE consists of 2,500 expert-level questions spanning mathematics, humanities, natural sciences, and other specialized fields \parencite{phan2025humanitys}.

Unlike traditional benchmarks that have become saturated with model performance exceeding 90\% accuracy, HLE was specifically created to be challenging enough that current state-of-the-art models demonstrate low accuracy and calibration. The benchmark includes both multiple-choice and short-answer questions with unambiguous, verifiable solutions that cannot be quickly answered through internet retrieval. This design ensures that HLE measures genuine reasoning capabilities rather than memorization or information retrieval.

The questions in HLE are developed by experts in their respective fields and vetted for clarity, correctness, and appropriate difficulty level. Each question is designed to test deep understanding and complex reasoning abilities that represent the current frontier of human academic achievement. The image below demonstrates how much older LLMs struggled on this benchmark when it was released:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{HLE_Bench_Results.png}
    \caption{Compared against the saturation of some existing benchmarks, HUMANITY’S LAST EXAM accuracy remains low across several frontier models, demonstrating its effectiveness for measuring advanced, closed-ended, academic capabilities \parencite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}.}
    \label{fig:HLE-Bench}
\end{figure}

HLE represents an important evolution in benchmark design, addressing the issue of benchmark saturation that has plagued earlier evaluation suites. By focusing on questions that require genuine expertise and multi-step reasoning, HLE provides a more accurate assessment of how close AI models are coming to truly human-level academic capabilities across diverse knowledge domains.

More recent models like Gemini 3.0 Pro have delivered very strong scores on this benchmark as shown in \cref{fig:gemini-benchmarks}. This benchmark is supposed to be one of the hardest ever created, and the fact that Gemini 3.0 Pro can perform so well on it shows how far large language models have come in recent years.

\textbf{SWE-bench Verified} is a human-validated subset of the original SWE-bench benchmark designed to more reliably evaluate AI models' ability to solve real-world software engineering problems. The original SWE-bench consists of 2,294 software engineering problems drawn from real GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests across 12 popular Python repositories \parencite{jimenez2024swebench}.

The SWE-bench Verified dataset addresses several limitations identified in the original benchmark through a comprehensive human annotation process conducted with 93 professional software developers \parencite{openai2024swebench_verified}. The key improvements include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Improved Unit Tests}: Many unit tests in the original SWE-bench were found to be overly specific or sometimes unrelated to the actual issue, potentially causing correct solutions to be rejected.
  \item \textbf{Better-Specified Problem Statements}: A significant portion (38.3\%) of original samples were flagged for underspecified problem statements that created ambiguity about what constituted a successful solution.
  \item \textbf{Reliable Evaluation Environments}: The new evaluation harness uses containerized Docker environments to make evaluating on SWE-bench easier and more reliable.
\end{itemize}

The filtering process resulted in removing 68.3\% of original SWE-bench samples due to underspecification, unfair unit tests, or other issues. The final SWE-bench Verified dataset contains 500 high-quality samples with difficulty ratings ranging from tasks estimated to take less than 15 minutes to those requiring more than 4 hours for experienced developers.

Performance on SWE-bench Verified shows significant improvement compared to the original benchmark. For instance, GPT-4o's performance increased from 16\% on the original SWE-bench to 33.2\% on SWE-bench Verified when using the best-performing scaffold \parencite{openai2024swebench_verified}. This suggests that the original SWE-bench was systematically underestimating model capabilities due to problematic samples rather than accurately reflecting their software engineering abilities.

SWE-bench Verified represents a crucial advancement in software engineering evaluation, providing a more accurate and reliable benchmark for assessing AI models' practical coding abilities in real-world scenarios. Overall, the SWE-bench Verified metric is designed to measure the coding abilities of LLMs, so companies using LLMs for cybersecurity should likely weigh this metric more heavily than the others when deciding which LLM to choose.

\subsection{Cybersecurity Related Benchmarks}

\subsubsection{CyberMetric}

CyberMetric is one of the early approaches to determine how effective humans are at solving multiple-choice cybersecurity related problems versus LLMs. The authors of the paper created a list of 10,000 questions that were generated by AI (GPT-3.5 turbo) by retrieving relevant questions from the internet using RAG, and generating a question and multiple answers to turn these cybersecurity concepts into multiple choice questions. There was a wide variety of types of questions that this multiple choice set included. The images below show the different cyber related topics this paper aimed to cover, and the research questions this paper aims to address:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{CyberMetric_research_questions.png}
        \caption{CyberMetric research questions}
        \label{fig:CyberMetric-research-questions}
    \end{subfigure}\hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{CyberMetric_Questions.png}
        \caption{CyberMetric cybersecurity topics}
        \label{fig:CyberMetric-topics}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{CyberMetric research methods \parencite{tihanyi2024cybermetricbenchmarkdatasetbased}}
    \label{fig:CyberMetric-questions-and-topics}
\end{figure}


The authors of this paper first conducted an experiment on a subset of cybersecurity questions taken from the original 10,000 that were generated by ChatGPT. They asked 30 participants to solve only 80 of these questions. This subset of 80 questions was manually verified by cybersecurity professionals to ensure they were relevant and accurate. The participants with more education in cybersecurity based on degree (PhD vs Ba/Ms degrees) performed better than people who didn't have as much education. This verified the validity of the dataset.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{CyberMetric_accuracy.png}
    \caption{CyberMetric benchmarks validating dataset \parencite{tihanyi2024cybermetricbenchmarkdatasetbased}}
    \label{fig:CyberMetric-dataset}
\end{figure}

The LLMs then were tested against the multiple-choice questions in the CyberMetric benchmark by measuring the percentage of questions they answered correctly. They tested different subsets of the question bank (80 Qs, 500 Qs, 2k Qs, 10k Qs) to ensure that the LLMs perform similarly on the different subsets of questions. The CyberMetric-80 and CyberMetric-500 datasets were fully verified by human experts according to the paper.

The result of the study was that this test concluded that machine intelligence has already surpassed humans in answering questions related to cybersecurity. This was the finding of the answer to the first research question, and the top performing model was GPT-4o which is a proprietary model. According to the paper, these were the results:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering

    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{human_vs_llm_performance.png}
        \caption{Comparing human vs LLM performance on CyberMetric-80}
        \label{fig:CyberMetric_human_vs_llm_performance}
    \end{subfigure}\hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{llm_performance_CyberMetric.png}
        \caption{Ranking LLM performance on CyberMetric 80Qs, 500Qs, 2k Qs, 10k Qs}
        \label{fig:CyberMetric_llm_performance}
    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{CyberMetric study results \parencite{tihanyi2024cybermetricbenchmarkdatasetbased}}
    \label{fig:2_3}
\end{figure}

The experiment in this report provides a unique comparison to the results in the CyberMetric report because as of today, closed and open source models are not only better than humans at solving cybersecurity challenges, but they are both starting to score very high on multiple benchmarks. In the CyberMetric paper, it is shown that the open source model \enquote{Mixtral} scores almost as good as GPT 4o in the image above. Nowadays, there are far more advanced open-source and proprietary models, and I will determine if this result is consistent with more recent models and ctf challenges.

\subsubsection{CyberSecEval 2}

The CyberSecEval 2 benchmark was created to test 3 major aspects of LLM security: 

\paragraph{prompt injection evaluation}
The first aspect involved testing for prompt injection. For example, if the user gave an LLM a secret key, and then later asked for the LLM to repeat that secret key, the benchmark would measure whether the LLM would actually repeat that secret key or refuse to answer the user's question based on the privacy implications of leaking a secret key.

\paragraph{vulnerability exploitation evaluation}
The second type of test, which is what our focus will be on in this report, is the ability for LLMs to exploit vulnerabilities. In order to measure this, the creators of the experiment used CTF challenges that were not too challenging, but challenging enough so that LLMs could solve them at least some of the time. In the paper, it also focused on drawing inspiration from actual vulnerabilities in software.

\paragraph{code interpreter abuse evaluation}
The last type of vulnerability that this benchmark evaluated is the willingness of an LLM to execute vulnerable code inside of a code interpreter. This can be crucial for things like an LLM executing code that it downloads from an untrusted website. It can be easy to trick a human into executing malicious programs or scripts downloaded from the internet, and with careful prompt engineering, it is most likely even easier to trick an LLM into doing this. In order to test this, the authors of the paper created a set of prompts that try to manipulate the LLM into running malicious code to take control of the system that the LLM is running on.

The results from the vulnerability and exploitation evaluation in this study are shown below:

\end{figure}

According to the results of this experiment, it seems that LLMs struggled solving some CTF challenges like SQL injection CTF challenges, and also basic buffer overflow challenges. Additionally, the proprietary GPT-4-turbo model performed the best in solving these challenges. Since this paper was created in April, 2024, I believe the results coming out of this experiment may differ from the results in my report. I am going to be testing newer, more robust open source models.

\subsubsection{NYU CTF Bench}

NYU CTF Bench is a specialized benchmark dataset designed specifically for evaluating large language models in offensive security tasks. Unlike general cybersecurity benchmarks that focus on theoretical knowledge or simplified vulnerability detection, NYU CTF Bench provides a comprehensive evaluation framework that more closely mirrors real-world cybersecurity scenarios. It is one of the first CTF benchmarks to include a large sample size of challenges in order to accurately measure LLM performance against hard ctf challenges.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{NYU_CTF_Bench_Vs_Others.png}
    \caption{Comparison of LLM-driven CTF solving \parencite{shao2025nyuctfbenchscalable}}
    \label{fig:NYU-Cyber-Bench_Models}
\end{figure}

What distinguishes NYU CTF Bench from other benchmarks is its focus on interactive cybersecurity challenges. The benchmark utilizes Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges sourced from the CSAW competitions, which are well-established in the cybersecurity community for testing practical offensive security skills \parencite{shao2025nyuctfbenchscalable}. These challenges require multi-step reasoning, vulnerability identification, and exploit development. The benchmark allows researchers to assess not only whether LLMs can solve security challenges, but also how effectively they can plan and execute multi-step attack sequences.

The benchmark also uses open-source models in their experimentation, but the problem is that it is comparing old, dated open source models to robust proprietary models. Since the time that this article was written, open-source models have advanced quite a bit. In the article, it uses Mixtral and Llama as representative open-source models, and neither of them solve any challenges according to the results below. Before this paper was releaased in February 2025, Deepseek was released in January 2025. Deepseek was one of the first robust open-source models, and its released even caused Nvidia stock to fall due to how good it was compared to top proprietary models. In this report, I will be using this Deepseek model, along with others that have came out since then that are even more robust.

    \label{fig:NYU-Cyber-Bench-Performance}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Cybench}

Cybench is a comprehensive benchmark developed by Stanford University for evaluating the cybersecurity capabilities of language models through practical Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges \parencite{zhang2025cybench}. What makes Cybench unique is its use of 40 professional-level CTF tasks sourced from four distinct competitions: HackTheBox 2024, SekaiCTF 2022-23, Glacier 2023, and HKCert 2023 \parencite{zhang2025cybench}.

Unlike other cybersecurity benchmarks that rely on theoretical knowledge questions or simplified vulnerability detection, Cybench evaluates language model agents in realistic environments where they must autonomously identify vulnerabilities, develop exploits, and execute them to capture flags \parencite{zhang2025cybench}. Each task includes a complete environment setup with task descriptions, starter files, and evaluators that verify successful flag submissions.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{cybench_agents.png}
\caption{Overview of the agent flow. An agent acts on memory $m_t$, consisting of the initial prompt
$m_0$ and the last three responses and observations $r_{t\text{-}3}, o_{t\text{-}3}, r_{t\text{-}2}, o_{t\text{-}2}, r_{t\text{-}1}, o_{t\text{-}1}$ to produce a
response $r_t$ and an action $a_t$. It then executes action $a_t$ on environment $s_{t\text{-}1}$ to yield an observation
$o_t$ and updated environment $s_t$. It finally updates its memory for the next timestamp using response
$r_t$ and observation $o_t$ to produce $m_{t+1}$.
\parencite{zhang2025cybench}}
    \label{fig:cybench-agents}
\end{figure}

The key innovation of Cybench is its introduction of subtasks that break complex challenges into intermediate steps, enabling more granular assessment of agent capabilities and partial credit evaluation \parencite{zhang2025cybench}. This approach allows researchers to identify exactly where language models fail in multi-step exploitation processes.

The results of the experiment these researchers at Stanford did is shown below:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{cybench_results.png}
    \caption{Performance and failure rates of different LLMs \parencite{zhang2025cybench}}
    \label{fig:Cybench-Performance}
\end{figure}

The Cybench evaluation revealed that even the best-performing models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet at 17.5\% and GPT-4o at 12.5\%) could only solve tasks with first solve times of 11 minutes or less, with none successfully solving challenges that took human teams longer than 11 minutes \parencite{zhang2025cybench}. This demonstrates the significant gap between current language model capabilities and human expertise in complex cybersecurity challenges. Additionally, it showed that LLMs even struggled with \enquote{subtask-guided performance} which involves breaking a problem down into pieces before attempting to solve it, then giving those separate steps and pieces to the LLM to solve by itself, and piecing together those steps to solve the entire challenge. The LLMs were able to solve the subtasks pretty effectively compared to piecing together the subtasks to solve the challenge.

Cybench has been adopted by major AI safety organizations including the US and UK AISI, Anthropic, Amazon, and OWASP, establishing it as the current state-of-the-art benchmark for evaluating language model cybersecurity capabilities \parencite{zhang2025cybench}.

Even though this paper provides an in-depth view into how LLMs work with solving multi-step CTFs similar to what my report will provide, this benchmark was created in April 2025, and it also doesn't include some of the most robust open-source models that will be featured in this report like Kimi, GLM, and Deepseek.
\subsection{Gemini 3.0}

In November 2025, Gemini 3.0 was released and it beat almost all benchmarks. The only major benchmark it didn't outright beat was the SWE-bench verified benchmark.

These are the results of the Gemini 3.0 benchmarks:

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{gemini_benchmarks.png}
    \caption{Gemini 3.0 benchmark results \parencite{google_gemini3_2025}}
    \label{fig:gemini-benchmarks}
\end{figure}


Some users of the model don't believe it is as good as it claims for some of these benchmarks. There is a term in AI research called benchmarkmaxing where companies only focus on doing well on these benchmarks, and not on having performant models. Some users think this could be the case for Gemini 3.0.

\subsection{How AI Models Think}

Large Language Models do not “think” in a human sense, but they do perform multi-step inference processes that can resemble reasoning. Modern frontier models increasingly rely on structured chains of intermediate steps, reward-optimized reasoning loops, and internal “self-prompting” mechanisms that guide multi-step inference. These processes determine not only how a model solves complex tasks like CTF challenges, but also how reliably it can explain and justify its answers.

Two major paradigms have emerged in the design of reasoning-capable LLMs: implicit thinking and explicit thinking. Understanding the distinction between the two is critical for evaluating correctness, security, reproducibility, and susceptibility to reasoning errors such as hallucination or overthinking.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is a prompting technique in which a model is instructed to generate step-by-step intermediate reasoning before giving its final answer. Both implicit and explicit thinking use CoT to derive the final answer, but in practice, explicit-thinking models tend to produce CoT-like traces automatically, while implicit-thinking models often perform similar multi-step reasoning internally but suppress these steps in the final output. Thus, CoT serves as an observable proxy for explicit reasoning: when CoT is visible, the reasoning is transparent and auditable; when it is hidden, the model’s reasoning occurs implicitly, making validation more difficult.

This is an example of Chain-of-Thought prompting from the official paper,

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{chain_of_thought.png}
    \caption{Chain of thought thinking process \parencite{cot_thinking_2022}}
    \label{fig:cot-thinking}
\end{figure}

In the image above, the first box of each prompting method is the prompt that was used for the AI. The box below it is response from the AI model. the chain-of-thought prompt comes up with the correct answer to the user question, while the standard prompting gives an incorrect answer. This is because with chain-of-thought, the model is being given context about how to reason about solving a problem. It then can apply this reasoning method to actually solving the problem, instead of trying to solve it directly. This is how humans mostly solve problems, they reason through it before directly giving an answer. Modern AI models are adopting this method of \enquote{reasoning} more and more which is what makes them so powerful. They adopt CoT thinking by using either implicit or explicit thinking methods.

\subsubsection{Implicit vs Explicit Thinking}

In the following article, the tradeoff in explicit vs implicit thinking model is shown. According to DigAI Lab,

\enquote{Implicit reasoning inherently suppresses intermediate outputs, rendering the underlying computation process opaque. This lack of visibility prevents us from knowing whether the model is performing genuine multi-step reasoning or merely exploiting memorized knowledge and spurious correlations}\parencite{li2025implicitreasoninglargelanguage}.

Explicit reasoning generally provides more fine-grained logical structure, which can reduce hallucination in multi-step tasks by forcing the model to commit to intermediate steps. Implicit reasoning, by contrast, relies on latent internal states, which can make errors harder to detect and can lead to confident but incorrect conclusions. In the methods of this paper, both explicit and implicit thinking models will be tested. Explicit-thinking models may be particularly valuable for cybersecurity organizations because they provide detailed, step-by-step reasoning traces. These logs allow analysts to audit how the model arrived at its conclusions, verify that each step is logically sound, and detect any hallucinations or incorrect assumptions that may influence the final answer.

In this paper, we will be testing a model that utilizes lots of explicit thinking (Kimi K2 Thinking) against a model that uses implicit thinking (Kimi K2 0905). Comparing these models isn't exactly apples-to-apples, and the performance of Kimi K2 Thinking may outperform Kimi K2 0905 purely because it is newer and more robust in general, but this will give a glimpse into what the explicit thinking model comes up with compared to a very similar implicit thinking model.

The different thinking mechanisms along with the specific AI models used in this paper, are shown in \cref{tab:models}. It is shown in this table that some of the good open-source models, and all of the proprietary models used in this report are implicit thinking models. This is partially because companies don't want to leak the reasoning processes of their models to other companies to train off of.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Using External Providers}

For my experimentation on whether open-source LLMs can effectively replace proprietary LLMs for solving company cybersecurity problems, I will be using external providers that give me access to models hosted on their platforms. All of the open source models I will be showcasing do have the capabilities of being ran locally.

\subsubsection{Openrouter}

Openrouter is a platform that provides API access to almost every publicly available large language model. There are companies and services that provide compute to Openrouter, along with access to an LLM model. In exchange, these services get paid for every token that Openrouter generates.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{openrouter.png}
\caption{Openrouter API to access external providers instead of hosting open-source LLMs locally}
    \label{fig:openrouter_platform}
\end{figure}

Openrouter has access to both open-source and proprietary models, but when using a proprietary model, the only provider that will be available is the one coming from the official company providing the services for that model. For open-source models, the different providers and pricing will vary, because these models are free to the public to host. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.48\textwidth}

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{GPT_Providers.png}

    \label{fig:Deepseek-Providers}
\end{subfigure}

\caption{Different models available and Openrouter and their providers}
\label{fig:Openrouter-Providers}
\end{figure}

In the images above, the only available provider for OpenAI's GPT 5.1 is OpenAI, the providers for Deepseek R1 include Parasail, DeepInfra, SiliconFlow, and NovitaAI, and many more. This shows the advantage to using open source. The end user can either host their own models, or use cheap external providers to get solid value for the amount they pay.

\subsubsection{Continue.dev}

Continue.dev is an open-source VSCode extension and also offers a CLI to allow AI to interact with your filesystem. I will be using the VSCode extension to allow LLMs to read my CTF files, and have a consistent prompt to test all LLMs equally.

Continue.dev supports both open-source and proprietary LLMs, and supports any OpenAI API compatible model to connect to it.

\subsection{Challenge Files and Standardized Prompt for All LLMs}
In \cref{tab:models}, the different LLMs that will be used in this experiment are displayed. These LLMs will be provided a standard script to solve the challenge. Additionally, these LLMs will not have any access to the internet, or other resources to give them an upper hand over other LLMs. They will be expected to use their knowledge of pure math and cryptography to solve this specific challenge. The LLMs will be given 3 tries to solve the challenge. If they have started to produce output that is close to an answer, but they are stopped due to hitting a max token output limit, I will prompt them again with the text, "Continue." This will allow them to continue trying on that specific trial. If after 3 trials, they cannot write a script to get the general solution to an answer, that attempt will be considered a fail to solve the challenge. If an LLM generates the general solution and everything is correct in terms of the mathematical derivations of answers, but they get something simple wrong like accidentally adding a number instead of subtracting, or not communicating with the server correctly (not encoding input into bytes correctly, hallucinating responses from the server, etc...), I will fix the minor issues with the script, test it, and if it works, that answer will be considered correct.

The LLM results with the best code that the LLM was able to come up with will be displayed, along with a summary of the reasoning that the LLM outputted as to why it thinks it has a good solution.
\subsubsection{SmileyCTF 2025 -- SaaS (Cryptography)}
For the cryptography challenge Saas from SmileyCTF 2025, the following prompt will be used:

\enquote{The code files you have been given contain a cryptography CTF challenge. Can you explain this challenge, and write me a file called solve.py that will solve it? Use pwntools in your solver script to interact with the remote server to get the flag. Assume that the remote server is on 127.0.0.1. You will only be given these files, and nothing more to solve the challenge. Do not assume any additional values or hints will come from the challenge server. Everything you need to solve the challenge is in the files.}

\textbf{Summary of Reasoning:} Query the oracle repeatedly with the value $4$. Since $r^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{n}$, we have $n \mid (r^2 - 4)$. Taking $\gcd$ values from multiple such outputs recovers $n$. For factoring, if we obtain a non-trivial root $r$ satisfying $r \not\equiv \pm 2 \pmod{n}$, then $\gcd(r-2, n)$ or $\gcd(r+2, n)$ yields a factor. Once $p$ and $q$ are known, compute $d = e^{-1} \bmod \varphi(n)$ and then compute the signature $s = m^{d} \bmod n$.

The square roots of $1 \pmod{n}$ are $1$, $n-1$, and two mixed CRT combinations. 
Since the maximum output is $n-1$, we obtain $n = \max(y) + 1$. 
To factor $n$, pick random $k$, query $f(k^2 \bmod n)$ to obtain $y$, and compute $d = \gcd(|k - y|, n)$. 
With probability $1/2$, $d$ equals $p$ or $q$. Repeating this about 40 times ensures success.

However, note that the function $f$ returns a value modulo $n$. Can we get $n$ by computing the modulus?'' 
This shows how the Deepseek model thinks a lot and can start to overthink answers. It got almost the entire reasoning correct at one point, but then forgets that it found out how to solve for n. The model became confused, cycled through its reasoning, and never produced a final solution or code.

Overall, the results of running these models against the challenge are very interesting. One concerning aspect of these results is that models like Claude Sonnet 4.5, GLM-4.6, and Gemini 3.0 pro are trying to use multiple square roots in order to solve RSA with a very large $e$ public exponent. This is a very bad practice, and basically signifies that these AI models have no idea on how to solve this RSA problem, so they are trying to come up with the most basic way to brute force the algorithm by taking square roots. This method of solving RSA is not correct at all for this type of problem. It is concerning because LLMs should explain that they don't know how to solve the problem similar to how Deepseek and GPT-5.1 do. Deepseek R1 and Deepseek V3.2 Speciale don't give any answer. They only show their reasoning, and eventually they continue thinking about solutions, but refuse to give answers until they are done thinking. After thinking for a while, these models ran out of output tokens, and failed to come up with any answer. This is preferred because it is generally a good thing for a large language model to admit they don't know the answer to a question rather than give an answer that they are not confident at all in.

Most of the LLMs failed when trying to find $n$ in this problem, which was the most difficult part of the problem. The three algorithms that did find $n$ did it in a very interesting way.

Claude Opus 4.5 and Kimi K2 Thinking both successfully recovered $n$ by exploiting a key mathematical property: for each query where the server returns a square root $y$ of $a^2$ modulo $n$, we have $y^2 \equiv a^2 \pmod{n}$, which means $n$ divides $y^2 - a^2$. By collecting multiple such pairs $(a_1, y_1), (a_2, y_2), \ldots$ and computing the greatest common divisor of all differences $y_i^2 - a_i^2$, they recovered $n$ as $\gcd(y_1^2 - a_1^2, y_2^2 - a_2^2, \ldots)$. This approach works because each difference is guaranteed to be a multiple of $n$, and the GCD of these multiples converges to $n$.

Grok 4.1 Fast was the only AI that was able to solve this challenge in one attempt. It used a clever observation about the square roots of 1 modulo $n$: since $r^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$, the possible roots are $1$, $n-1$, and two mixed CRT combinations. By querying $f(1)$ multiple times and observing that the maximum output value was always $n-1$, it deduced that $n = \max(y) + 1$.

All three of these solutions are slightly different in how they recovered $n$, and they all recovered $p$ and $q$ the same way that the solution in appendix A does it. They all use addition or subtraction on two distinct roots on $p$ and $q$ to factor $n$. These unique methods of finding $n$ show how ctf challenges can be solved in different ways, and present solid benchmarks for LLMs due to their wide variety of solutions once the LLM is able to figure out the main idea of how to solve the problem.

\section{Discussion: Model Context Protocol in Cybersecurity and CTFs}

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized interface that allows LLMs to securely call functions from external systems. Introduced as an open-source standard in 2024, MCP serves as a universal translator between AI models and security tools, enabling seamless integration and automation of cybersecurity workflows. This protocol transforms how AI systems can access, control, and analyze cybersecurity infrastructure, opening new possibilities for both offensive and defensive security operations.

HackTheBox has developed an open-source MCP implementation that provides LLMs with access to CTF challenges and automated testing scripts within a structured environment. Their implementation offers a standardized interface for connecting AI assistants to the HackTheBox platform functionality, enabling seamless integration of AI into CTF competitions and cybersecurity training \parencite{hackthebox_mcp_server}.

According to HackTheBox, \enquote{MCP provides a standardized way to plug modern capabilities into competitions, making CTFs a closer mirror of real-world security operations} \parencite{hackthebox_mcp_server}. This standardization is particularly valuable when comparing open-source and proprietary models, as it ensures that any performance differences are due to the models' inherent capabilities rather than environmental factors or implementation advantages.

\subsection{Standardized Testing Environments for Model Evaluation}

The integration of MCP servers with CTF platforms creates a standardized testing environment that provides more accurate evaluation for both open-source and proprietary models. Unlike traditional benchmarks that may favor one model architecture over another, MCP-based CTF environments establish a level playing field where all models interact with identical challenges through the same standardized interface. The emerging ecosystem of MCP servers for cybersecurity evaluation includes several specialized implementations that further enhance standardized testing. The following are some examples:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Kali MCP Server}: Acts as a bridge to Kali Linux environments, allowing AI models to access professional security tools through a standardized interface \parencite{wh0am1232024kalimcpserver}.
  \item \textbf{DeepEval MCP Framework}: Provides standardized evaluation primitives for testing LLM performance across different cybersecurity tasks, enabling fair comparison between model architectures \parencite{confident2024deepeval}.
\end{itemize}

These implementations demonstrate how MCP servers create a unified testing methodology that applies equally to both open-source and proprietary models. By providing identical interfaces to the same security tools and challenges, MCP environments eliminate the advantages that might arise from proprietary integrations or specialized optimizations that favor one model type over another.

\subsection{Real-World Implementations}

HackTheBox's MCP server exemplifies how this technology is transforming cybersecurity education and practice. Their implementation provides AI assistants with programmatic access to the HackTheBox platform's CTF challenges and automated testing environments, enabling seamless integration of AI into CTF competitions and cybersecurity training \parencite{hackthebox_mcp_server}.

According to Hackthebox:

\enquote{We’re laying the foundation for a new mode of competition where speed, automation, and machine intelligence become part of the game. At Hack The Box we always champion \enquote{learning by doing,} and now \enquote{doing} includes leveraging advanced tools and AI to enhance your capabilities, automate tedious processes, and reinvent how challenges are approached} \parencite{hackthebox_mcp_server}.

Key capabilities include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Seamless Event Management}: Access and explore all available CTF events via the MCP interface, with real-time visibility into participants and active challenges.
  \item \textbf{Performance Insights}: Monitor team scores, retrieve challenge solve data, and analyze success rates to guide strategy.
  \item \textbf{Challenge Lifecycle Automation}: Start, stop, and monitor challenge environments automatically, reducing manual operations during high-stakes competitions.
  \item \textbf{Flag Submission}: Submit flags through validated, automated processes with immediate feedback and scoring confirmation.
\end{itemize}

The impact of this integration is already evident in the cybersecurity community, with research showing that nearly two-thirds (63\%) of CTF participants are already using AI tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot during events \parencite{hackthebox_mcp_server}.

\subsection{Structured Interfaces for Security Tools}

MCPs provide standardized interfaces for a wide range of cybersecurity tools, transforming how AI systems interact with security infrastructure. The \enquote{Awesome Cyber Security MCP} repository catalogs numerous implementations that demonstrate the protocol's versatility across the security domain \parencite{awesome_cyber_security_mcp}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Web Application Security}: Burp Suite MCP enables AI-driven web application testing by connecting Burp Suite to AI clients through MCP, allowing for automated vulnerability discovery and exploitation \parencite{burp_suite_mcp}.
  \item \textbf{Network Reconnaissance}: Tools like Nuclei MCP provide fast vulnerability scanning capabilities, while Shodan MCP offers AI access to comprehensive internet-connected device search and CVE information.
  \item \textbf{Reverse Engineering}: Ghidra MCP and IDA Pro MCP enable autonomous binary analysis, allowing AI systems to perform complex reverse engineering tasks with minimal human guidance.
  \item \textbf{Password Recovery}: Hashcat MCP provides natural language-driven hash cracking, making password recovery more accessible to security analysts.
\end{itemize}

These implementations demonstrate how MCPs create a unified ecosystem where AI can leverage specialized security tools without requiring deep knowledge of each tool's specific interface or implementation details. This helps both open-source and proprietary models perform better in security CTF challenges, and in the real world.

\subsection{Future Benchmarks}

The performance of LLMs on CTFs must be further studied by giving LLMs access to an MCP protocol that allows them to analyze the challenge and test different solutions autonomously. The future of benchmarking these LLMs in order to determine how well they are able to solve CTF challenges should involve MCP access to a wide variety of tools and services. These tools allow the LLM to solve a problem similarly to how a human would, and therefore they can better demonstrate how they can solve real-world challenges instead of giving the LLM the code of the challenge in a prompt with no added context, and asking it to solve it. When an LLM doesn't know how to solve a problem, it can try different approaches by using a variety of tools like Ghidra for vulnerable binaries and Burp Suite for testing vulnerable web applications.

Some LLMs are better at agentic tasks that involve using tools to help them solve problems. These LLMs should have full capabilities to use this to their advantage. Tools like web searching, Ghidra, Burp Suite, and much more are tools that a human would use during a typical CTF to figure out how to solve the problem. LLMs should be given the same tools in order to make an accurate portrayal of which open-source and proprietary LLMs are the best at solving these challenges, and the best at solving cyber security related issues in general.

\section{Conclusion}

This study investigated the capabilities of both open-source and proprietary large language models in solving complex cybersecurity challenges, specifically focusing on a CTF cryptography problem. Through empirical testing of ten different models across various reasoning architectures, we have gained valuable insights into the current state of LLM performance in cybersecurity applications.

\subsection{Study Limitations}

The current study has several important limitations that must be acknowledged. First, our evaluation was conducted using only a single CTF challenge, which limits our ability to generalize findings to the real world. While the SaaS cryptography challenge was carefully selected to test multiple aspects of cryptographic reasoning and problem-solving, different types of cybersecurity challenges (such as web exploitation, binary reverse engineering, or network forensics) might yield different performance patterns across models.

Second, the sample size, while including ten diverse models representing both open-source and proprietary types, remains relatively small for drawing definitive conclusions about the broader capabilities of each model category. The rapidly evolving nature of LLM development means that newer models and unique models are constantly being developed. In order to get a true representation of open-source versus proprietary models, more models in both categories must be measured.

Additionally, our testing methodology provided models with the challenge code directly, without allowing them to interact with the challenge environment dynamically. This differs from real-world penetration testing scenarios where security professionals typically interact with live systems, observe behaviors, and iteratively refine their approaches.

\subsection{Open-Source vs. Proprietary Performance}

The results of this study reveal an interesting and somewhat unexpected pattern regarding the performance of open-source versus proprietary models. While proprietary models (Claude Opus 4.5 and Grok 4.1 Fast) successfully solved the challenge, the open-source model Kimi K2 Thinking also demonstrated successful problem-solving capabilities. This challenges the conventional wisdom that proprietary models uniformly outperform their open-source counterparts in complex reasoning tasks.

More significantly, our analysis of the reasoning processes revealed that open-source models often demonstrated comparable, and in some cases superior, reasoning approaches compared to proprietary models. The explicit thinking models, particularly those in the open-source category, provided detailed step-by-step reasoning that allowed for better understanding of their problem-solving strategies. This transparency is particularly valuable in cybersecurity applications where understanding the reasoning behind a conclusion is as important as the conclusion itself.

The fact that some open-source models produced incorrect solutions while showing strong reasoning capabilities suggests that the gap between open-source and proprietary models may be more about implementation, context, and prompt refinement. This is encouraging for organizations considering open-source alternatives for cybersecurity applications, as it indicates that with proper prompting, tools, and context, open-source models could potentially achieve parity with proprietary alternatives.

\subsection{Implications for Future Research}

The findings of this study highlight several important directions for future research in LLM cybersecurity applications. First, there is a clear need for more comprehensive benchmarking studies that include multiple CTF challenges across different cybersecurity domains. Such studies would help establish more reliable performance metrics and identify specific areas where different model types excel or struggle.

Second, the emergence of the MCP presents a promising avenue for future LLM evaluation in cybersecurity. As discussed in the previous section, MCP provides standardized interfaces that allow LLMs to interact with cybersecurity tools and environments in a controlled, reproducible manner. This capability addresses one of the key limitations of our current study by enabling models to engage with challenges more dynamically, similar to how human security professionals approach problems.

Future benchmarks should incorporate MCP-enabled testing environments that allow LLMs to use tools like Ghidra for reverse engineering, Burp Suite for web application testing, and various network analysis tools. This approach would provide a more accurate assessment of models' practical cybersecurity capabilities and their ability to leverage specialized tools effectively.

\section{Mathematical Derivation for SmileyCTF 2025 SaaS Challenge}

\subsection*{Square roots modulo \(n\) and factor recovery}

Let \(p\) and \(q\) be distinct primes with \(p \equiv q \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\), and let \(n = pq\).
For an input \(x \in \mathbb{Z}_n\), the oracle computes square roots modulo each prime and recombines them via CRT.

\subsection*{Square roots modulo a prime}

Let \(p\) be an odd prime with \(p \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\).
If \(x\) is a quadratic residue modulo \(p\) (and \(x \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}\)), Euler's criterion gives
\[
x^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}.
\]
Consider
\[
\left(x^{\frac{p+1}{4}}\right)^2
= x^{\frac{p+1}{2}}
= x \cdot x^{\frac{p-1}{2}}
\equiv x \cdot 1
\equiv x \pmod{p},
\]
so \(x^{\frac{p+1}{4}}\) is a square root of \(x\) modulo \(p\):
\[
\boxed{\left(x^{\frac{p+1}{4}}\right)^2 \equiv x \pmod{p}}.
\]

If \(x\) is not a quadratic residue, then
\[
\left(x^{\frac{p+1}{4}}\right)^2 \equiv -x \pmod{p}.
\]

Thus, in all non-degenerate cases,
\[
r_p^2 \equiv \pm x \pmod{p},
\qquad
r_q^2 \equiv \pm x \pmod{q}.
\]

\subsection*{CRT recombination of square roots modulo \(n\)}

Let
\[
r_p \equiv x^{\frac{p+1}{4}} \pmod{p},
\qquad
r_q \equiv x^{\frac{q+1}{4}} \pmod{q},
\]
and define
\[
A \equiv q(q^{-1} \bmod p),
\qquad
B \equiv p(p^{-1} \bmod q).
\]
Then for independent signs \(a,b\in\{\pm1\}\),
\[
r_{a,b} \equiv a r_p A + b r_q B \pmod{n}.
\]

\subsection*{Recovering \(n\) from complementary roots}

If two roots correspond to opposite signs, say \((a,b)\) and \((-a,-b)\), then
\[
r_{a,b} + r_{-a,-b} \equiv 0 \pmod{n}.
\]
Taking representatives in \([0,n-1]\),
\[
r_{-a,-b} = n - r_{a,b}.
\]
Thus, after sorting the four roots,
\[
\boxed{n = r_{\min} + r_{\max}}.
\]

\subsection*{Extracting a prime via a GCD}

Consider a pair differing only in the \(q\)-component:
\[
r_{a,b} = a r_p A + b r_q B,
\qquad
r_{a,-b} = a r_p A - b r_q B.
\]
Their difference is
\[
r_{a,b} - r_{a,-b} = 2b\, r_q B.
\]
Reducing modulo the primes:
\[
r_{a,b}-r_{a,-b} \equiv 0 \pmod{p},
\qquad
r_{a,b}-r_{a,-b} \equiv 2b r_q \pmod{q}.
\]

Thus,
\[
\boxed{\gcd(r_{a,b}-r_{a,-b},\, n) = p}.
\]
Similarly, a pair differing only in the \(p\)-component yields \(q\).
In practice, collect the four roots and compute:
\[
p = \gcd(r_i - r_j,\, n), \qquad q = \frac{n}{p}.
\]

\subsection*{Forge the signature}

Once \(p\) and \(q\) are known:
\[
\varphi(n) = (p-1)(q-1),
\qquad
d \equiv e^{-1} \pmod{\varphi(n)}.
\]
Given the challenge value \(m\), the RSA signature is:
\[
\boxed{s \equiv m^d \pmod{n}}.
\]

Submitting \(s\) satisfies \(s^e \equiv m \pmod{n}\) and reveals the flag.
